    was on 6th September 1992, I was on my way to Mandevu to visit my sister Susan. I reached by the place she was
    staying but unfortunately I found she shifted to another place, I didn’t wanted to communicate because I wanted it
    to be a surprise visit. I got my phone out of my pocket and called her phone but I couldn't reach her because her
    phone was off, in mind I was like what’s happening to me my sister shifted and her phone is off how am I going to
    find her and to make matters worse I had only transport for going to
    Mandevu only. I sat down for a minute and started to think about how I will get home by foot and the distance long
    to walk, it can take hours and hours of walking . I started my journey but before I reached far, a certain lady
    recognized me " hey! Hey! Ba uncle" then I looked back, she said " ningakuonesheni pe ekukila a
    sista anu"(mean I can show you where your sister shift to. and i replied "yayi mwagwila nchito kwambili"(thank you
    so much). as we were walking i met my friendfrom jacaranda basic(primary) school, she didn't see me so i had to call
    her, "Bupe! Bupe! i called
    then she turned to me and she gave me a hug and she said to I will never forget your voice and i said to her is that
    true, if it true then you are a quite a friend. We continued talking, we talked about school and how life has been.
    The Bupe raised a question, she asked me if I still had feelings for her because when we were in grade 9 I told her
    that I had feelings her but she never gave an answer and that left me a bit broken. I had lots of questions running
    in mind, was I not good enough for her, were we too close or maybe it was because I was broke. And at that time life
    was a bit tough, you know no parents. Being an orphan is not an easy thing. We were best friends what happened to us
    she asked. But at that moment I was still thinking about the first question she asked. Bupe had a lot of questions
    so she continued asking. I answered her first question, yes I still have feelings for you but what about Joe I asked
    because when we were at school I heard rumors that were dating Joe. No! me dating Joe that’s something else Joe is
    my brother, you can’t be serious Enesto, I felt ashamed after learning the new information. I had to apologize
    because that’s what a normal human being can do. She accepted my apology and we continued talking and at that time I
    was single. I told myself how can refuse to this wonderful opportunity. She me asked why I was in Mandevu on that
    day, I told her about the situation I was in after I found out that my sister shifted. We exchanged contacts but
    Bupe didn’t even wanted to waste any time, she came out open and told me that she didn’t wanted to lose me and she
    wanted to us to start dating. But you know us guys we don’t usually take time to think through some other staff
    especially it is about a girl. But in this case I was already in love with Bupe at so there was no reason to think
    whether to be in a relationship. I have always loved you Enesto, we will talk on the phone I told her because the
    lady who was going to show me where my sister has shifted to was tired of waiting. Make sure you call me when reach,
    and assured her that I will call. I thought I will be the first one to call but Bupe didn’t want to waste anytime,
    my phone rang and my ringing tone was Adele’s song Hello because was my favorite artist. Have arrived safely she
    asked
